# Frog'n'Bee

[Frog'n'Bee](https://frognbee.com)

This application was designed to allow me and my partner to take the thinking out of dates. We can plot down some ideas at any time we think of something we want to do together and when it comes up to a date night or we are bored, we can go through our ideas.

## Initializing

1. `yarn && yarn build`

## Some Notes

- This repository is public so that I can take advantage of some cool features on GitHub and some external tools
- It is intended to be used by me and my partner and I have Firebase rules in place to prevent other users reading or writing
- Frog'n'Bee was used because it's our two favourite creatures
